Azure Storage Service

⮚ Diff types of data and requirements
  ⮚ Relational, non-relational/No-SQL, datasheets, images, videos, backups
  ⮚ Storage, access, security, availability, latency, processing, backup

⮚ Diff types of Data Service
  ⮚ Azure Blobs: Text and binary data
  ⮚ Azure Files: Managed file shares (SMB Protocol)
  ⮚ Azure Queues: Messaging
  ⮚ Azure Tables: NoSQL store

⮚ Features
  ⮚ Durable and highly available – redundancy across datacenters or regions
  ⮚ Secure – all data encrypted by default
  ⮚ Scalable – massively scalable
  ⮚ Managed - Azure handles hardware maintenance, updates, and critical issues for you.
  ⮚ Accessible - accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.
      ⮚ Clients libraries are available in all languages
      ⮚ Support scripting in PowerShell or Azure CLI



Azure Storage Redundancy

⮚ Locally redundant storage (LRS) – Three synchronous copies in same data center

⮚ Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) – Three synchronous copies in three availability zones (AZs)

⮚ Geo-redundant storage (GRS) - LRS + Asynchronous copy to secondary region (three more copies using LRS) – Read only access
  ⮚ Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) – Read Access on GRS

⮚ Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) – ZRS + Asynchronous copy to secondary region (three more copies using LRS) – Read only access
  ⮚ Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS) – Read Access on GZRS



Blob Storage

⮚ Blob - Binary Large Object
  ⮚ Any type or format
  ⮚ Text, Images, audio, video, excel, backup files

⮚ Use cases:
  ⮚ Storing files for shared access
  ⮚ Video and audio streaming
  ⮚ Storing data for analysis (Data Lake Gen2)
  ⮚ Writing to the log file
  ⮚ Storing data for disaster recovery, backup, and archiving

⮚ Flat structure

⮚ Provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data.
  ⮚ http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net



Three types of Blob Storage

⮚ Block Blobs:
  ⮚ For large objects that doesn't use random read and write operations, files that are read from beginning to end
  ⮚ Such as media files or image files for websites.

⮚ Page Blobs:
  ⮚ Optimized for random read and write operations.
  ⮚ Provide durable disks for Azure Virtual Machines (Azure VMs)

⮚ Append Blobs:
  ⮚ Optimized for append operations. e. g. Logs
  ⮚ When you modify an append blob, blocks are added to the end of the blob only
  ⮚ Updating or deleting of existing blocks is not supported
  ⮚ For example, you might write all of your trace logging to the same append blob for an application running on multiple VMs



Storage Access Tiers

⮚ Data stored in the cloud can be different based on how it's generated, processed, and accessed over its lifetime.

⮚ Pricing
  ⮚ The volume of data stored/month
  ⮚ Types of operations performed
  ⮚ Number of operations performed
  ⮚ Data transfer cost, if any
  ⮚ The selected data redundancy option

⮚ Organize your data based on attributes like frequency of access and planned retention period.

⮚ Blob access tiers
  ⮚ Hot access tier
  ⮚ Cool access tier
  ⮚ Cold access tier
  ⮚ Archive access tier


Storage Access Tiers

⮚ Hot
  ⮚ Frequently accessed data
      ⮚ Example - images for your website
  ⮚ Low latency
  ⮚ Higher access cost

⮚ Cool
  ⮚ Infrequent accessed data
      ⮚ Example - invoices for your customers
  ⮚ High latency
  ⮚ Lower cost
  ⮚ Stored for at least 30 days

⮚ Cold
  ⮚ Infrequent/Rarely accessed data
  ⮚ High latency
  ⮚ Lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the cool tier
  ⮚ Stored for at least 90 days

⮚ Archive
  ⮚ Rarely accessed data
      ⮚ Example - long-term backups
  ⮚ Highest access times and access cost
  ⮚ Latency in hours
  ⮚ Stored for at least 180 days
  ⮚ Use Case: Business policy mandated Data Archiving, long term retention like healthcare data


Performance Tiers

Standard
⮚ Backed by magnetic drives
⮚ Support – All storage account
⮚ Optimized for high capacity and high throughput
⮚ Provides the lowest cost per GB.
⮚ Best for applications that require bulk storage or where data is accessed infrequently.
⮚ Example: Backup and DR datasets, media, pictures, videos.

Premium
⮚ Backed by solid state drives (SSD)
⮚ Good for virtual machines and workloads that need low latency and high I/O performance
⮚ Examples: transactional databases, big data analysis, IOT, AI or ML
⮚ Block Blob: Best for high transaction rates or low storage latency
⮚ File Shares: Best for enterprise or high performance applications that need to scale
⮚ Page blobs: Best for random read and write operations

Note: You cannot change performance tier after account creation
