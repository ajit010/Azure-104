Azure Storage Redundancy

⮚ Locally redundant storage (LRS) – Three synchronous copies in same data center

⮚ Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) – Three synchronous copies in three availability zones (AZs)

⮚ Geo-redundant storage (GRS) - LRS + Asynchronous copy to secondary region (three more copies using LRS) – Read only access
  ⮚ Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) – Read Access on GRS

⮚ Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) – ZRS + Asynchronous copy to secondary region (three more copies using LRS) – Read only access
  ⮚ Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS) – Read Access on GZRS



Blob Storage

⮚ Blob - Binary Large Object
  ⮚ Any type or format
  ⮚ Text, Images, audio, video, excel, backup files

⮚ Use cases:
  ⮚ Storing files for shared access
  ⮚ Video and audio streaming
  ⮚ Storing data for analysis (Data Lake Gen2)
  ⮚ Writing to the log file
  ⮚ Storing data for disaster recovery, backup, and archiving

⮚ Flat structure

⮚ Provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data.
